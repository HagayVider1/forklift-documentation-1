If you are an administrator, you can see and work with components (providers, plans, etc.) for all projects.

If you are a non-administrator, you can only see and work only with the components of projects you have permissions for.

[TIP]
====
You can see which projects you have permissions for by clicking the *Project* list, which is in the upper-left of every page in the *Migrations* section except for the *Overview*.
