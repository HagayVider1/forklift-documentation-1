= Creating a migration plan

You can create a migration plan by using the {ocp} web console.

A migration plan allows you to group virtual machines to be migrated together or with the same migration parameters, for example, a percentage of the members of a cluster or a complete application.

You can configure a hook to run an Ansible playbook or custom container image during a specified stage of the migration plan.

.Prerequisites

* If {project-short} is not installed on the target cluster, you must add a target provider on the *Providers* page of the web console.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, click *Migration* -> *Plans for virtualization*.
. Click *Create plan*.

. Specify the following fields:

* *Plan name*: Enter a migration plan name to display in the migration plan list.
* *Plan description*: Optional: Brief description of the migration plan.
* *Source provider*: Select a source provider.
* *Target provider*: Select a target provider.
* *Target namespace*: Do one of the following:

** Select a target namespace from the list
** Create a target namespace by typing its name in the text box, and then clicking *create "<the_name_you_entered>"*

* You can change the migration transfer network for this plan by clicking *Select a different network*, selecting a network from the list, and then clicking *Select*.
+
If you defined a migration transfer network for the {virt} provider and if the network is in the target namespace, the network that you defined is the default network for all migration plans. Otherwise, the `pod` network is used.

. Click *Next*.
. Select options to filter the list of source VMs and click *Next*.
. Select the VMs to migrate and then click *Next*.
. Select an existing network mapping or create a new network mapping.
. . Optional: Click *Add* to add an additional network mapping.
+
To create a new network mapping:

* Select a target network for each source network.
* Optional: Select *Save current mapping as a template* and enter a name for the network mapping.
. Click *Next*.
. Select an existing storage mapping, which you can modify, or create a new storage mapping.
+
To create a new storage mapping:

.. If your source provider is VMware, select a *Source datastore* and a *Target storage class*.
.. If your source provider is {rhv-full}, select a *Source storage domain* and a *Target storage class*.
.. If your source provider is {osp}, select a *Source volume type* and a *Target storage class*.

. Optional: Select *Save current mapping as a template* and enter a name for the storage mapping.
. Click *Next*.
. Select a migration type and click *Next*.
* Cold migration: The source VMs are stopped while the data is copied.
* Warm migration: The source VMs run while the data is copied incrementally. Later, you will run the cutover, which stops the VMs and copies the remaining VM data and metadata.
+
[NOTE]
====
Warm migration is supported only from vSphere and {rhv-full}.
====
.  Click *Next*.
. Optional: You can create a migration hook to run an Ansible playbook before or after migration:
.. Click *Add hook*.
.. Select the *Step when the hook will be run*: pre-migration or post-migration.
.. Select a *Hook definition*:
* *Ansible playbook*: Browse to the Ansible playbook or paste it into the field.
* *Custom container image*: If you do not want to use the default `hook-runner` image, enter the image path: `<registry_path>/<image_name>:<tag>`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The registry must be accessible to your {ocp} cluster.
====

. Click *Next*.
. Review your migration plan and click *Finish*.
+
The migration plan is saved on the *Plans* page.
+
You can click the {kebab} of the migration plan and select *View details* to verify the migration plan details.
